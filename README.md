# Evaporated

A program that allows users to see how much total time they have wasted in their Steam library

For the app to function as intended you need to input the ending of your custom steam URL in the searchbar.

This is a React Router based app. Thus it is important to run the following command to ensure proper function:

### npm install react-router-dom

We also require a steamAPI wrapper, it can be installed like this:

### npm install steamapi

We also use an express server as a proxy to access the API:

### npm install express

### npm install cors

### npm install body-parser

That should cover everything! Have fun! Let me know if there are any improvements you would suggest :)
